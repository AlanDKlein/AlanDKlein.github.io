  <h1>Essential Woodworking Tools</h1>

  <h2>Table Saw *</h2>

        <p>Most beginning woodworkers invest in a table saw early in the game. Table saws produce cuts that aren’t easily achieved with other saw types. 
          They’re designed like upside down circular saws where the blade is exposed from below the saw table or work surface. Blade depth and angles
          are easily adjusted for precision.

  <h2>Jigsaw *</h2>

      <blockquote cite="https://www.yorksaw.com/beginners-guide-to-must-have-tools-for-woodworking/">
        <p>Every beginning woodworker should invest in a decent jigsaw. They’re also called saber saws because of their
          reciprocating, saber-like blade. These electric power tools are designed to make intricate cuts that can be
          straight, curved or serpentine. Think of the lines in a jigsaw puzzle, and you’ll know what a jigsaw is
          capable
          of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jigsaws are completely different than circular saws. Instead of revolving blades, jigsaws cut with a back and
          forth or up and down motion. Blades vary in tooth numbers and composition. They’re used to cut metal and
          plastic as well as wood. Fine-tooth blades are used for sawing veneers, while coarse tooth-blades are for rough and
          fast
          work.

  <h2>Compound Miter Saw *</h2>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <blockquote cite="https://www.yorksaw.com/beginners-guide-to-must-have-tools-for-woodworking/">
      <p>Compound miter saws are a step up from regular circular saws. They still take the same rip, crosscut and
        combination blades as circular saws. However, they’re fixed in an arm or a track much like the radial arm saws
        they’ve almost replaced. Common blade diameters are 10 and 12-inch, but compound miter saws can be fitted with
        the smaller 7 ½” size.

  <h2>Band Saw *</h2>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <blockquote cite="https://www.yorksaw.com/beginners-guide-to-must-have-tools-for-woodworking/">
      <p>There’s nothing like a bandsaw for ripping rough stock or making intricate curved cuts. These power tools are a
        combination of circular and saber saws, where teeth are fixed on a continuously looped, flat steel band and
        revolve around upper and lower pulleys. A flat table is mounted between the pulleys that tilts for angled cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bandsaws come in many sizes. It depends on the size of stock you’ll be cutting and how intricate of cuts you
        want to make.

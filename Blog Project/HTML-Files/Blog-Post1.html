    <h1>Woodworking Tips & Tricks</h1>

    <h2>Sanding made easier *</h2>

                Sanding woodwork by hand may seem like a chore, but with special tools and high-quality sandpaper,
                you’ll get excellent results that often outshine a power sander. Besides, it’s quieter, doesn’t produce clouds
                of dust, and may get into places power sanders can’t.  Use a sanding block for faster, more efficient results. It 
                distributes sanding pressure more evenly and maintains a flatter surface than merely folding a piece of sandpaper. 
                Also, change sandpaper often. Sand with the grain of the wood, especially for the final grits.
            </p>
            <p>
                To remove deep scratches and stains, angle across the grain up to about 45º for the first sanding.
                Before moving to the next finer grit, sand with the grain to remove all cross-grain scratches. For sanding
                painted surfaces, buy clog-resistant sandpaper. The paint will build up slower than on standard sandpaper.

    <h2>Measure with a drafting square *</h2>

            <p>Make accurate measuring and marking layouts on boards faster and easier with a drafting square –
                available at any art supply store.
                When you need an accurate square in the 2- to 3-foot range, drafting squares beat the cumbersome drywall
                squares for accuracy and eliminate the hassle of hooking up a carpenter square.

    <h2>Keep a clean, orderly workspace *</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <blockquote
            cite="https://www.http://hardwooddistributors.org/postings/8-woodworking-tips-to-boost-your-efficiency">
            <p>Achieving efficiency in your shop can sometimes be as simple as clearing clutter from your work area. A
                disorderly work area can hinder your productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another tip: Only keep out items that you use daily. Everything else should be put in designated areas
                so they’re quickly retrievable when needed.

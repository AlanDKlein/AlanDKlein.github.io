    <h1>Udacity Capstone Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This is the final project in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer
        nanodegree program. The project is designed to bring together all of the
        skills learned throughout the program. The objective was to create a
        Travel Planner application which incorporated various pieces of
        functionality which is have outlined below.
    </p>
    <h2>Application Workflow</h2>

    <h3>Get Trip Details</h3>
    <p>At the initial launch of the application the "Save This
        Trip" button is disabled. After the user enters some input into the date
        and location fields and selects "Get Trip Details" the button becomes
        active. Additionally there are edits to ensure the date fields are input
        correctly (the depart date is prior to the retun date, the depart date is
        not in the past, etc.). </p>
    <p>When the "Get Trip Details" is selected a series
        of API and function calls are made.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The date_diff_indays() function is
            called to determine how far in the future the departure date is. This is
            used later in the Weatherbit API.</li>
        <li>The Geonames api is called with the
            City, State, Country and API Key to get the longitude and latitude of the
            destination city.</li>
        <li>The longitude and latititude are pulled from the
            response and put into the Weatherbit API call to get either current or
            forecasted weather data. The result from date_diff_indays() is used as a
            parameter for this API.</li>
        <li>The results from the Weatherbit API are parsed
            and used to create verbiage to display to the user.</li>
        <li>The Pixabay API is
            then called with city, state, and country parameters to get a picture of
            the destination. FIrst the city parameter is used, and if no picture of
            the city is found the API is called again with country as a parameter.</li>
        <li>
            The next step in the flow is to call the REST Countries API with the
            country parameter. The data returned by this API is passed to the
            buildPageFacts() function which then parses it and adds verbiage to
            display on the screen.</li>
        <li>Finally the countdown() function is called with
            departure_date and return_date parameters. This function first
            determines how long the trip is by calling the date_diff_indays()
            function, and then starts a countdown from today until the departure date.
            The results of this are put into readable verbiage to display on the
            screen. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Save Trip, Retrieve Trip, Delete Trip</h2>
    </p>
    <h3>Save Trip </h3>
    <p>The "Save This Trip" button is disabled until the "Get Trip Details"
        is selected and a current trip is displayed on the screen. When selected the
        saveThisTrip() function in the **processTripData.js** file called and the
        relevent data points are retrieved from the DOM and put into in a Javascript
        object which is then saved to LocalStorage. The object is converted to a
        string with the JSON.stringify method prior to saving to storage. This
        function then dynamically builds a radio button and text to display in the "My Saved
        Trips" section of the documnent.</p>
    <h3>Retrieve Trip</h3>
    <p>To view the details of a
        previously saved trip the user must first select the trip to view and then
        press the "Retrieve Trip" button. This will then call the getSavedTrip()
        function in the **processTripData.js** file. The function loops through the
        saved trips to find the one selected and then retrieves the data from
        LocalStorage. It then parses the data with JSON.parse() and inserts the
        data into the appropriate fields on the DOM. Finally it calls the
        countdown() function to start a countdown for this trip. </p>
    <h3>Delete Trip</h3>
    <p> To
        delete a previously saved trip the user must first select the trip to delete
        and then press the "Delete This Trip" button. This will then call the
        deleteTrip() function in the **processTripData.js** file. The function loops
        through the saved trips to find the one selected and then deletes the data
        from LocalStorage with the removeItem(key) method. Next the function
        removes the radio button and verbiage from the DOM, and calls the
        countdown() function with 0's as parameters to stop the countdown and clear
        the DOM element.</p>
        <h2>Web APIs and Local Storage</h2>
    <h3>Web APIs called</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Geonames</li>
        <li>Weatherbit </li>
        <li>Pixabay </li>
        <li>REST Countries </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Local Storage/Retrieval</h3>
    <p>The project made use of the HTML5
        localStorage functionality.</p>

          <p class='meParagraph'>
            Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio page. My name
            is Alan Klein and I've been in the IT industry for nearly 30 years.
            After a successful 23 year career at AT&T I took an early retirement offer
            at the end of 2019, and have since continued my education by
            completing a Udacity&copy; nanodegree program in Front End Web
            Development. I have a passion for coding and I want to work with small businesses
            to help them with their web design and development needs using my HTML,
            CSS and Javascript skills.<br><br>

            When I'm not working I like to spend time outdoors enjoying nature or
            indoors in my woodshop creating small pieces for friends and family. I enjoy the creativity that
            woodworking provides and the satisfaction of working with my hands
            to create something beautiful and useful for people to enjoy. The
            first project for Udacity was to create a "Personal Blog" which I
            dedicated to woodworking. Please check it out in the "Projects"
            section below.
            <br><br>
            I am also an avid reader, history buff, and cigar afficianado. ðŸ“šðŸš¬

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p class='eduParagraph'>
          I completed the Front End Web Development nanodegree program from
          Udacity&copy in October, 2020. This program consisted of lessons and
          hands-on projects in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Links to the
          various projects and the code I created for them are below in the
          "Projects" section of this page.
          <br><br>


          During my tenure at AT&T I earned a Masters Degree in Computer
          Science from Webster University in 2000. I earned this degree while
          working full time as a developer at AT&T.
          <br><br>
          In 1991 I completed the "Computer Career Program" at Maryville
          University. This was an accelerated 30-week program in computer
          programming and system design. This is the program that launched my
          career in the IT world.
          <br><br>
          My undergraduate work was completed in 1984 with a Bachelor of
          Health Science degree from the University of Missouri - Columbia.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          My career in the IT industry began in 1991 when I completed the
          30-week "Computer Career Program" at Maryville University in St. Louis, MO.
          This program was an acclerated program designed to jump start a career in
          IT.
          <br><br>
          My first IT job was as a COBOL developer for a very small firm (less
          than 10 employees) and from there I moved to the corporate world
          with MCI Communications. Moving on to Bunge North America I began
          developing user interfaces using the PowerBuilder development tool.
          In 1996, because of my PowerBuilder experience, I was hired by AT&T
          (Southwestern Bell at the time) where I spent 23 years, first as a
          developer and the last 15 years as a technical solutions architect.
          <br><br>
          I am a firm believer in life-long learning, and I've continued that
          philosophy with the completion of Udacity's Front End Web Developer
          nanodegree program. The work that I've done from this program is
          listed under the "Projects" section of this page. There I have links
          to the code on GitHub for your reveiw.
